# OpenVR XR SDK Package

The purpose of this package is to provide OpenVR XR SDK Support. This package provides the necessary sdk libraries for users to build Applications that work with the OpenVR runtime. The OpenVR XR Plugin gives you access to all major VR devices through one interface. Explicit support for: HTC Vive, HTC Vive Cosmos, HTC Vive Tracker, Oculus Touch, Windows Mixed Reality, Logitech VR Ink, and Valve Index. Other SteamVR compatible devices are supported though may have inaccurate or incomplete features.

# Documentation

There is some brief documentation included with this plugin at /Documentation~/com.valve.openvr.md

# Input choice

First, you have a choice to make between using SteamVR Input, and Unity XR Input. The two systems are currently mutually exclusive.

If you would like to use all the functionality SteamVR Input has to offer (user rebindable inputs, skeletal input, etc) you will need to also install the SteamVR Unity Plugin. This can be found at (https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/2.6.0b1).

If you would prefer to use Unity’s XR Input so your application can use multiple SDKs and therefore be deployed to multiple stores you can use this plugin standalone.


## Known Issues:
* Display Provider
  * OpenVR Mirror View Mode (default) can cause black screens in the game view. Please send us bug reports if this happens.
  * OpenVR Mirror View Mode requires use of Linear Color Space (Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > (Rendering) Color Space)
  * In certain use cases, changing RenderScale and ViewPortScale in runtime causes some performance spikes
  * Vulkan currently only supported in Multi pass stereo rendering mode 
* Input Provider
  * You cannot access skeletal finger information. This api is incompatible with SteamVR Legacy Input.
